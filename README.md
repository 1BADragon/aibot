A simple webpage I used to learn how web dev with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS looks. Not framework
size librarys (React, Angular, etc), no Typescript, only a couple deps for things like rendering
Markdown, and lodash (cause duh). The whole site is a SPA(ish) that
can be served using a simple http server such as Python's.

Enjoy.
